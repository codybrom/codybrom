# Hi, I'm Cody 👋👨🏻‍💻

I design experiences that empower people to work better. That means I wear a lot of hats: digital marketer ⚡, martech wrangler 👨‍💻, automation wizard ⚙, cloud CRM champion ☁, content writer ✍, eCommerce specialist 💲, front-end designer 🖌, Zendesk admin 🤓 and so many others.

## Find me around the web 🌎:
- Sharing updates on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/codybromley/">LinkedIn</a> 💼
- Collecting badges on Trailhead <a href="https://trailblazer.me/id/codybromley">trailblazer.me/id/codybromley</a> 📹 ✍🏾
- Writing things very sporadically on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@codybrom"> @codybrom</a> 🏓
