# Hi, I'm Cody 👋👨🏻‍💻

I work with teams to build experiences that empower people to work better. That means I wear a lot of hats: product manager 👷🏻‍♂️, UX champion 🔁, calendar wrangler 👨‍💻, process wizard ⚙, cloud CRM advocate ☁, copywriter ✍, expert beginner 🤓 and so many others.

## Find me around the web 🌎:
- Sharing updates on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/codybromley/">LinkedIn</a> ✌️💼
- Collecting badges on Trailhead <a href="https://trailblazer.me/id/codybromley">trailblazer.me/id/codybromley</a> 🏞️☁️
- Writing things very sporadically on Medium <a href="https://medium.com/@codybrom"> @codybrom</a> 📜✍
